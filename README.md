Manim toolkit for cryptographic scenes.

Local install: clone the repo locally and run `pip install -e .` from the repo's root directory (or `pip install .` if you don't expect to ever make local changes).

In lieu of documentation (for now), please see the code samples and associated renders in the [example gallery](examples/index.md).

This is a Manim plugin. Manim requires plugins to be explicitly enabled using a command-line flag or `manim.cfg` file.
See e.g. the example in [tests/manim.cfg](tests/manim.cfg), or the official [Manim docs](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/plugins.html#using-plugins-in-projects) for more info.

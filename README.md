# cranim

Manim toolkit for cryptographic scenes. Check out the example gallery: [https://nccgroup.github.io/manim-cranim/](https://nccgroup.github.io/manim-cranim/)

Local install: From the repo's root directory, run `pip install -e .` (or `pip install .` if you don't expect to ever make local changes).

This is a Manim plugin. Manim requires plugins to be explicitly enabled using a command-line flag or `manim.cfg` file.
See e.g. the example in [tests/manim.cfg](tests/manim.cfg), or the official [Manim docs](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/plugins.html#using-plugins-in-projects) for more info.

cranim is documented by example; in lieu of API docs, please see the code samples and associated renders in the [example gallery](https://nccgroup.github.io/manim-cranim/).
